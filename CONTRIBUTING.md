#  Contributing to Kasha Installer

First of all, **thank you for your interest in contributing!** This is an actively developing project and all contributions are welcome.

> **Important note:** Kasha Installer is in an organizational phase. The priority right now is to **document, structure, and report**, not to optimize code.
> 
> **Documentation Lead:** `Crow_rei` is currently in charge of the documentation

## 📋 Before starting

Please read this completely. We have some important considerations to keep the project organized:

### 1️⃣ **Explicit and well-documented commits**

Even if we don't work professionally, documentation is key to finding bugs.

**Rule:** Commits must be **clear and specific**.

```bash
✅ GOOD:
git commit -m "feat: add luks encryption support"
git commit -m "fix: correction in grub installation path"
git commit -m "docs: update build instructions"

❌ BAD:
git commit -m "changes"
git commit -m "updates"
git commit -m "fixed"
```

**Recommended format (Conventional Commits):**
```
<type>: <short description>

<optional long description>
```

**Valid types:**
- `feat:` — New functionality
- `fix:` — Bug fix
- `docs:` — Documentation
- `refactor:` — Code change without new functionality
- `test:` — Tests
- `chore:` — Maintenance tasks

---

### 2️⃣ **Found a bug?**

**First:** Verify that the software runs (even with the bug).

**Rule:** If the software runs, **DO NOT FIX THE BUG**, just report it.

**Steps:**

1. Open an [Issue](../../issues) with:
   - **Descriptive title:** E.g. "Bug: neko_installer does not detect NVMe drives"
   - **What you expected:** Clear description of what should happen
   - **What happens:** What actually happens
   - **Steps to reproduce:** Step-by-step how to reach the bug
   - **System:** Distro, GTK version, environment (UEFI/Legacy)

2. **Label:** Mark as `bug` (if it exists)

3. **Wait for organization:** Maintainers will decide when and how to fix it

**Example of a well-made issue:**
```
**Title:** Bug: installer does not mount /boot/efi automatically

**What I expected:** That when selecting UEFI, the FAT32 partition mounts to `/boot/efi`

**What happens:** The partition mounts to `/boot` instead, breaking GRUB.

**Steps:**
1. Run: `sudo ./neko_installer`
2. Select UEFI mode
3. Go to Partitions tab
4. Auto-partition the disk
5. See that mount points are incorrect

**System:** Void Linux, GTK 3.24.43, UEFI
```

### 3️⃣ **Have an improvement idea?**

**Rule:** Document the idea, **DO NOT touch the code** until the project is organized.

**Steps:**

1. Open a [Discussion](../../discussions) or [Issue](../../issues) with the `enhancement` label
2. Describe:
   - What improvement you propose
   - Why it would be useful
   - Expected impact
3. **Wait for feedback** from maintainers before making changes

**Current priority:** Organize project > Optimize code

---

### 4️⃣ **Are you going to use AI for support?**

**Important rule:** Avoid letting AI modify code unnecessarily.

 

**Reason:** Undocumented changes can break things we haven't documented yet. Stability is more important than optimization right now.

## 🏗️ Code Standards

### Identifier Naming (C Language)

| Element | Style | Example |
|:---------|:-------|:--------|
| **Functions** | `snake_case` | `load_installed_versions()`, `launch_installer()` |
| **Variables** | `snake_case` | `selected_disk`, `mount_path` |
| **Constants/Macros** | `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` | `MAX_PARTITIONS`, `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT` |
| **Structs** | `PascalCase` | `PartitionConfig`, `AppData` |
| **Folders** | `lowercase` | `src/`, `core/`, `ui/` |
| **Files** | `snake_case` | `installer_steps.c`, `partition_utils.h` |

### Structure Example

```text
src/
├── core/
│   ├── installer.h
│   ├── installer.c
│   ├── partition_utils.c
│   └── utils.c
│
├── ui/
│   ├── ui.h
│   ├── ui.c
│   └── ui_callbacks.c
```

### Code Documentation

- Always document **public functions**
- Use clear comments in complex logic
- Follow the existing style in files

**Example:**
```c
/**
 * Detects the EFI partition on a given disk.
 * 
 * @param disk_name The disk identifier (e.g., /dev/sda)
 * @return Allocated string with the partition path, or NULL if not found
 */
char* find_efi_partition(const char *disk_name);
```

## 🔄 Contribution Flow

### 1. Prepare your environment

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://codeberg.org/javiercplus/Kasha-Installer.git
cd Kasha-Installer

# Create a branch
git switch -c feature/your-change
# or
git switch -c fix/your-bug
```

### 2. Make changes

- Follow code standards
- Write clear and explicit commits
- If using AI, avoid unnecessary code changes

### 3. Compile and test locally

```bash
# Compile normal build (Void Linux specific)
make

# Or compile universal build (Distro-agnostic)
make universal

# Execute (requires sudo for disk operations)
sudo ./neko_installer
# or
sudo ./neko_installer_universal
```

### 4. Open a Pull Request

**Before PR:**
- ✅ Compiles without errors
- ✅ Tested locally
- ✅ Commits are clear
- ✅ Updated documentation if necessary

**In the PR:**
- **Title:** Briefly describe the change
- **Description:** Explain what changed and why
- **References:** Link related issues with `Fixes #123`

**Example:**
```markdown
# Added: Integrity validation for LUKS encryption

## Description
Added validation that `cryptsetup` exists before allowing LUKS formatting.
This prevents crashes when the user selects encryption but lacks the tool.

## Changes
- Added `validate_cryptsetup()` method in `utils.c`
- Updated UI flow to disable encryption checkbox if unavailable
- Added clear error message to user

## Testing
- Tested locally on Void Linux
- Validated with and without `cryptsetup` installed

Fixes #42
```
